## NEW GUIDELINES FROM USER INTERACTIONS (2024-12-19)

*   **TanStack Query vs. Axios:**  TanStack Query is a data fetching and state management library, while Axios is an HTTP client.  They often work well together; TanStack Query manages the state, and Axios handles the actual HTTP requests.  Consider using this combination for projects requiring efficient data management and state handling.
